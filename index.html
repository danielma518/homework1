<h3>Introduction</h3>
A chart showing the sales volume of Mac products in 2005 in terms of quarters.

<h3>Why is this visualisation problematic/ confusing/ misleading?</h3>

<p>The baseline line of the Y-axis is 1000, making the change looks more drastic than it should be. Also, as it is a 3D chart, the closer the bars are, the bigger they look, which creates an illusion.</p>

<h3>Further illustrations & calculations</h3>

<p>If we create a line graph with an Y-axis that starts with 0 with the same set of data, it would be evident that the growth is just very mild. So we can conclude the 3D design and the Y-axis are two big factors that makes the chart misleading.</p>

<h3>Suggestions</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Ues a 2D design instead of 3D to avoid illusion</li>
  <li>Adjust the Y-axis to show the actual growth</li>
  <li>Use a wider and flatter frame to make the chart</li>
</ol>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
A graph showing the change of median income for US men in 2012 in terms of age group.

<h3>Why is this visualisation problematic/ confusing/ misleading?</h3>

<p>The baseline line of the Y-axis is $32000 instead of $0, making the drop in income looks more drastic than it has been. </p>

<h3>Further illustrations & calculations</h3>

<h3>Suggestions</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Adjust the Y-axis by starting from 0 in order to show the actual growth accurately.</li>
</ol>
